> Tips: Note on Huaqiangbei headset using app

- Since there are many types of Huaqiangbei headphones on the market, and the chip schemes of different categories of Huaqiangbei headphones are different, the functional effects presented on the APP will be different.

- Some Huaqiangbei headphones may not support the charging bin power display, if you have not shown the charging bin power you can try to view through the accurate power scheme.
  1. Connect the headset to the phone.
  2. Place the headphones in the box with the lid open.
  3. Press and hold the small dot on the back cover to make the headset enter the pairing state (the box indicator flashes white).
  4. Wait for app battery update (Accurate battery only works in headset pairing mode)

> Finally, if you still can't check the charging capacity, it may be that the headset itself cannot support.

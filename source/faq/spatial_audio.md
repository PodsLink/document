- At present, the application does not support spatial audio Settings, and spatial audio is multi-track audio music. Currently, only Spatial Audio Music on Apple Music supports spatial audio.
- Spatial stereo is a new feature in IOS15.1 that converts two-channel audio into multi-track audio and then outputs it to the earbuds.
- PodsLink does not support spatial audio switch control. Although it is useless to open it now, there may be supportive music on Android later, and we will follow up on this program.

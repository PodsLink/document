Only applicable to AirPods Beats series headphones.
1. Connect the earbuds to the phone.
2. Place the headphones in the box with the lid open.
3. Press and hold the small dot on the back cover to make the earbuds enter the pairing state (the box indicator flashes white).
4. Wait for app battery update (Accurate battery only works in earbuds pairing mode)

> Finally, if you still can't check the charging capacity, it may be that the earbuds itself cannot support.

#### Function Introduction
For member users to provide auxiliary search earbuds function
- The app records the geo-location of the last earbud connection (the app needs to be running in the background) to help you locate the approximate range of the earbuds;
- If earbuds are nearby, try connecting them and playing a sound to help locate them;
- If you only lose one earbud, try to close the left/right channel to help confirm;
- If none of the above helps you, try the attached earbud device.
